## Social and Economic Networks Models and Analysis

> This is a course I finished on Coursera. 

> This course requires knowledge of advanced mathematics, logical reasoning and modeling.

> To me, Social network analysis is so fascinating that it covers fields of graph thoery, Game thoery and Topology and even indicates philosophy. Besides, it is a good test for my aesthetical taste:), for visualization plays an important role during the analysis journay.


## Tools Applied:
* R Statnet:

 statnet is a suite of software packages for network analysis that implement recent advances in the statistical modeling of networks. The analytic framework is based on Exponential family Random Graph Models (ergm). statnet provides a comprehensive framework for ergm-based network modeling, including tools for model estimation, model evaluation, model-based network simulation, and network visualization.
